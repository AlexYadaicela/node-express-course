1. In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?

The purpose of the asyncWrapper was to eliminate the repititive use of try-catch blocks throughout the various route declarations.  

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and an error message are sent 
back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. 
Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references that class. 
Complete the code:
```
const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    // your code here  
    next(customErrorHandler(`No task with id: ${taskID}`, 404))
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});  

```
